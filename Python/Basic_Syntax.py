# <- Used to Comment
# Syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create a Program.
# Python Syntax have has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java Programming Languages.
# However, there are some definite differences between the languages.
# Python is an iterpreted language (But it can be compiled)

# To enter Python interavtive Mode from Terminal (or prompt) use 'python3'

# Basic Syntaxes

print("Hello world!") # Bless the first print ever

print() # Used to give space to text and give context

print("Here we can write thing we want the program to...")
print("print")

print()

print("By default, on the end of all pythons 'prints' there's this regex '\\n'") # \n

print()

print("But of course we can change it using 'args', basically we say 'end='XXX'' where XXX is the new regex or word, character, you choose")
print("It also need a comma between the real text, ex:  print(\"original text\", end='I know Python')")

print()

print("To test it, let's use 'I know Python' on the end", end='I know Python')
print("But... we are TOO CLOSE")

print()
print()

print("Removing the normal '\\n' makes the next one to print together with the first, so we may need to use spaces, like so")

print("To test it, let's use 'I know Python' on the end ", end='I know Python ')
print("But... we are still CLOSE")

print()

print("This can be used better with regex or when intentionally leaving things for the user to read")
print("That way, we can use variables and not repeat code or prints...")


# Starting with Python Identifiers

# A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
# An identifier starts with a letter A/a to Z/z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
# Python does not allow punctuation characters such as &commat;, $, and % within identifiers.

# We also have NAMING CONVERNTIONS for Python identifiers
